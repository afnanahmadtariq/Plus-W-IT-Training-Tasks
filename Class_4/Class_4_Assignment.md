## 📌 Assignments

### 1️⃣ Basic Operations with 1D and 2D NumPy Arrays
**Objective:**
- Perform basic operations like creating 1D and 2D arrays using NumPy.
- Calculate the sum of a 1D array and the mean of a 2D array.
- Transpose a 2D array.
- Implement the program in a function and manage global variables.

### 2️⃣ Image Processing with NumPy (Indexing & Slicing)
**Objective:**
- Perform image processing tasks such as slicing portions of an image, inverting the colors, and printing the results.
- Create the program within a function, avoiding the use of global variables.

**File:** [Image Processing with NumPy](./Assignment_Tasks/Image_Processing.ipynb)

### 3️⃣ Augmented Reality Transformation
**Objective:**
- Apply linear algebra transformations to an image, such as scaling, rotation, and translation using NumPy and OpenCV.
- Implement functions to scale, rotate, and translate images.
- Display the transformed images using OpenCV's `imshow` function.

**File:** [Augmented Reality Transformation](./Assignment_Tasks/AR_Transformation.ipynb)

### 4️⃣ Face Detection from Image Arrays
**Objective:**
- Detect faces and facial features in an image using OpenCV and NumPy.
- Use Haar Cascades to detect faces and eyes in an image.
- Slice the image array to extract regions of interest, such as faces and eyes.
